##  Extend_Ex0_final Raw GNSS-Based Navigation System
Welcome to the final assignment in Autonomous Robotics course taken in Ariel University (Semester B 2024) ! <br>
This system is designed for real-time location estimation using raw GNSS measurements while addressing signal disruptions and identifying spoofed satellites. The system includes advanced algorithms for data filtering and accuracy enhancement.

### Review of Autonomous Robotics Assignment: GNSS Raw Measurements

#### Introduction
The assignment on GNSS Raw Measurements is a thorough exploration of satellite-based positioning systems, specifically focusing on the computation and understanding of pseudo-ranges using GNSS data. The task is designed to provide students with a hands-on experience in parsing GNSS raw data, implementing a positioning algorithm, and translating coordinates into different formats, culminating in the creation of visual and textual outputs.

#### Content and Scope
The task is well-structured, beginning with an educational foundation where students are encouraged to familiarize themselves with GNSS concepts and pseudo-ranges. The progression from theoretical learning to practical application is logical and beneficial for a deep understanding of GNSS systems.

#### Implementation Challenges
The assignment requires students to build a parsing tool that converts GNSS log data into a specified CSV format, which is a practical skill that complements the theoretical learning. The challenge escalates with the implementation of a positioning algorithm using an RMS-based approach to determine the satellite coordinates in ECEF format. This hands-on approach to learning complex algorithms is commendable.
